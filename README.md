🌟 Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning** 🌟

Hey fam! 👋

I'm super excited to share a recent project I've been working on – predicting diabetes using machine learning! 📊✨

In this project, I utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build a predictive model. The goal was to analyze patient data and predict whether a person has diabetes based on various features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

🔍 **Key Steps:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
2. **Feature Scaling:** Standardized the features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
3. **Model Training:** Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict diabetes.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
5. **Prediction:** Used the model to predict diabetes for new patients.

🎥 I've recorded a video walkthrough of the entire process, from start to finish. It's a deep dive into the world of machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modeling.


I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback! Let's connect and discuss how machine learning can revolutionize healthcare and beyond.
